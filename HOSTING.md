## Hosting vectara-answer

This guide provides specific instructions to help you host your `vectara-answer` application on one of the popular hosting providers.
We keep adding new hosting providers regularly - please let us know if you need instructions for a hosting provider that is not yet included.

### Overview

To run a hosted version of `vectara-answer` you would need to have two files: `.env` and `queries.json`.

To prepare the `.env` file, which combines the information from `config.yaml` and `secrets.toml`, run the following command:

`python3 prepare_config.py /path/to/<YOUR-CONFIG.yaml> <profile>`

At the end of this process you should have two files ready to go:
1. `.env` generated by the above python3 command
2. `queries.json` that specifies the queries for your application.
